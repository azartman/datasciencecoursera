Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set in R. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Setup

First, data will need to be downloaded from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Once the data has been obtained, it will need to be unzippied in your working directory.

Project Summary

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Info

You can find addition information about the variables and data in the CodeBook.md file
